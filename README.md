# seefood

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

The project is  inspired from the silicon valley show and its main goal is to replicate the original desing and implementation as much as possible.
The whole app architecture has been designed in flutter and the food detection is done by a tensorlfow light model to have better on device  inference.
Here are few demo shots of the APP :
